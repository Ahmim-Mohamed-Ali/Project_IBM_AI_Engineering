# IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate Projects

Welcome to the repository! This collection includes some of the key projects and labs I completed during my journey through the **IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate**. 

Throughout this certification, I gained hands-on experience with various AI and Machine Learning techniques, including Deep Learning, Generative AI, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The projects in this repository showcase my work in deploying AI models, fine-tuning transformers, and using advanced techniques such as **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Transfer Learning**.

## Projects and Labs Included:

### 1. **Project_Gratio RAG Application with LLaMA 3.2**
   - This project leverages a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to upload a document and answer questions related to its content.
   - Technologies used: **LangChain**, **OpenAI Embeddings**, **ChromaDB**, **LLaMA 3.2**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

### 2. **Capstone_DeepLearning_Project with PyTorch**
   - In this project, I built a **Deep Learning** model using **ResNet-118** and implemented it with **PyTorch** for image classification.
   - Applied **Transfer Learning** and model optimization to improve performance.

### 3. **Pre_Trained And Fine-Tuning BERT on the IMDB Dataset**
   - Fine-tuned a pre-trained **BERT** model on the **IMDB dataset** for sentiment analysis of movie reviews.

### 4. **Other Labs and Mini Projects**
   - Additional smaller projects and labs that I worked on during the certification, focusing on various aspects of **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and **Generative AI**.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python**
- **PyTorch**
- **Keras**
- **TensorFlow**
- **LangChain**
- **OpenAI Embeddings**
- **ChromaDB**
- **BERT**
- **LLaMA**
